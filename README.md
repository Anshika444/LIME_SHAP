# LIME & SHAP Model Explainability Demo

This project demonstrates **model explainability** using:
- [LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)
- [SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)](https://github.com/shap/shap)

We use the **Iris dataset** and a **RandomForestClassifier** to show:
- Local explanations with **LIME**
- Global and local explanations with **SHAP**

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `LimeShap.ipynb` â†’ Main Python script for training the model and generating explanations.
- `lime_explanation.html` â†’ LIME visualization (saved when running the script in terminal).
- `README.md` â†’ This file.

---
LIME results will be printed in the console and saved as lime_explanation.html.

SHAP plots (summary_plot, force_plot) will open as static plots.

What Youâ€™ll See

LIME â†’ Explains the prediction of one sample in terms of top contributing features.
SHAP Summary Plot â†’ Shows global feature importance.
SHAP Force Plot â†’ Explains the contribution of each feature for one prediction.
